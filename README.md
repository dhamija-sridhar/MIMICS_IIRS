# MIMICS_IIRS
Since we are modelling a naturally occurring phenomena there are a huge number of input parameters to consider. The major one are listed below:
 
System parameters
Radar Frequency: Measured in Ghz, this is the operating frequency of the radar, kept at 1.25 GHz
Wavelength: Appropriate wavelength has to be selected in order for backscattering to occur, we utilize L band, C band and X band for this. 
Incident Angle: Backscattering is quite dependent on the incident angle of the wave.

Environment parameters:
Canopy density: modelled as tree per square metre, for eg 0.5 in one of the simulation run
Trunk height and diameter: 
Leaf density:modelled as leaves per cubic meter, for eg 48.46

Dielectric value of :
Leaves
Needles
Branches
Trunks
Ground Surface 

The output of the simulation is the value of backscattering coefficient for various values of angle of incidence for different wavelengths.

The 


We have 4 different types of polarized output to consider, HH,VV, HV and VH.

An example :
ollowing parameters are considered,

Canopy Density =  0.50 Trees per square meter, Crown Height =  2.12 meters, 
Trunk Height = 17.70 meters, Trunk Dielectric = 28.190 -j 7.830,
Trunk Diameter = 14.200 cm
Branch Diameter =  3.000 cm, Branch Length =   1.860 meters
Needle Density =  0.4820E+03 needles per cubic meter, Needle Diameter = 0.100 cm, Needle Length = 13.001 cm
